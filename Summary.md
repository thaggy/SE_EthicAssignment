Software Engineering Ethic's Assignment

For my first three rows, I have listed Technical Systems I said were affected. I said primarily User Computer systems, 
which would include users of Social Media's electronic devices, would be primarily unaffected.  This would include things 
such as a facebook users computer or phone. I put these as unaffected because the physical hardware was not being hacked in anyway
and the hardware was not be altered. I did say that the web servers systems of social media companies were affected however.
I selected them as affected because the accounts created would actually alter the hardware as they would store and save memory on the
hardware of said fake accounts. This would probably breach the social media's terms of service and be unethical to store the said
propaganda on their hardware. I also chose to include Government Computer Systems which I said would also be unaffected. These
systems would be in a similar situation to the User Computer Systems. There was no hack and not a breach of Government Computers in this
scandal.

For the next three rows, I selected sociotechnical systems. The Social Media Company systems, which includes the Employee/Administator
of the Web Servers and their use of the systems, would be affected by this ethics breach. This breaches their ethics as their platform
is being used in such a way that is not intended and breaches their terms of service. This also affects other users using the service as 
the fake accounts would be seen by other users and change their experience on the platform. This would again breach the ethics of the 
service as you are affecting other users personal experience on platforms not intended for political use. I then finally said that user
systems that involved miscellaneous services would not be breached. So non-social media services would be largely unaffected by such a breach.
For example, someone's Netflix account would largely be unaffected by their Facebook account. Thus no ethics here was breached.
